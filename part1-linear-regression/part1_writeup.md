# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
the r^2 value is 0.6257932855... and it says shows the user how well the line of best fit actually fits the data.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
For someone who is 43, the predicted systolic blood pressure is 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think this model's predictions are goodenough, but not enough to predict someone's blood pressure. This would be because of how little data there is in the graph. If we had much more data, the predictions would most likely be at least slightly more accurate.
