# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The model is more effective than the model I made in the previous lesson because it can use data to see how effective it is. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
the R squared coef tells us how linear the training data is.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
Yes the model is somewhat/mostly accurate, which is evident in the accuracy of the testing data. But that does not change the fact that the data is split at random, meaning there can be some "weirder" results
