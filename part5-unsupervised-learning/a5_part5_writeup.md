# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
I couldn't come up with fun names, sorry :(
Red: Lower-Class(spenders) due to high spending, but low income
Orange: Middle-Class due to medium income and medium spenidng
Green: Upper-Class(spenders) due to high income, high spending
Blue: Upper-Class due to high income, low spending
Purple: Lower-Class due to low income, low spending

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
lower parts of orange, maybe in between purple and blue

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
Looking at the graph, the easiest groups to "wow" would probaly be people in the Upper-Class(Spenders) group, because they have the money to spend, and they show it with their high spending score, so maybe something that can grab their attention even in the slightest amount, or something that looks fancy and is slightly expensive to assure them that its something that will make them look richer(assuming they spend so much to make themselves look rich to others).
